**Calensync** was created in order to solve a simple but very annoying problem: make sure that all my (many) Google calendars were synchronized, so that myself, collaborators, and services such as Calendly could easily know when to arrange meetings.

# Sync directions
You can sync in any direction you want, simply create a sync rule going from the source calendar (i.e. where are events copied from) to the destination calendar (where they will be copied).
This gives you full customization on how you want events to be duplicated.

# Privacy
Of course, if you're going to be syncing calendars together, you may not want all your colleagues to know you're going to the doctor. 
To solve that you can decide, for each syncing direction, whether to copy the event details, or instead save them as `Busy`. 
## Example setup
- You sync your personal events to your professional calendar using the `Busy`
- You sync your professional events to your personal calendar with the full details


# Your data is safe
We never save any event detail of any kind. In fact, we don't even save any metadata of events.
That means
- we don't sell the data
- we don't use the data
- we don't even see the data
It's open-source, so if you really want you can directly check the repository!

### Code
You're welcome to contribute by creating a fork and, when finished, a PR.

### Request
If you have a request, please either email me at me@edoardobarp.com or, might even simpler, directly from the feedback pop-up in the dashboard

## Possible features

1. Integrate Outlook
2. Add a "buffer" to events, possibly only on certain calendars. For example, you could imagine all events in calendar A have an automatic +15minutes buffer, but not events from calendars B and C.
3. Allow for custom message instead of `Busy`
